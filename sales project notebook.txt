Introduction:

For years, I focused on user experience (UX). Now, after transitioning into Data Analysis, I'm using that same optimization mindset to solve major business problems.

I attended a free bootcamp at Foresight BI and worked on a sales project including data visualization. The largest threat to profitability, according to this project's analysis of a multi-year sales dataset totaling $2.29M across 5,009 transactions, is a huge office supply problem rather than a lack of effort.

The Problem:

The goal was to use data to focus on identifying which product categories and regions offer the biggest potential for profit improvement.

Methodology & Visuals:
Tool: Microsoft Power BI 
Approach: I used standard time-series and geographical charts for context, then moved to the Key Influencers visual to statistically test what drives either high or low performance.

Key Insights:
The West and East Regions are the clear revenue drivers
2. With around $750K in sales, the West area leads, closely followed by the East. The South region, on the other hand, generates the least amount of revenue (around    $400K), suggesting that market intervention is necessary. 
3. Technology generates the highest total sales, followed by Furniture. These are our growth engines
4.  When the category is Office Supplies, sales are most likely to decline. This indicates that although technology generates large sums of money, our average order value is statistically declining due to the large volume of low-value office supply transactions.

Recommendations:
For Operations:  Examine low-value subcategories such as labels and fasteners. In order to boost total profit, these things should be eliminated or packaged with other products if they are excessively expensive to ship or fulfil in relation to their pricing.

For Marketing: Use the high frequency of Office Supplies sales as an upselling opportunity. Whenever a customer buys a low-cost item, the system should prompt a promotion for a higher-margin product (like a premium desk chair or a keyboard) to quickly lift the Average Order Value.
