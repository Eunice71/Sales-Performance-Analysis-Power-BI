# Sales Performance Analysis (Power BI Project)
## Project Overview 
This project is a detailed analysis of a multi-year sales dataset (totaling $2.29 Million across 5,009 transactions).

## The Problem 
The goal was to use data to focus on identifying which product categories and regions offer the biggest potential for profit improvement
Methodology & Visuals

Tool: Microsoft Power BI 

Approach: I used standard time-series and geographical charts for context, then moved to the Key Influencers visual to statistically test what drives either high or low performance.

## Key Insights:

•	The West and East Regions are the clear revenue drivers

•	With around $725K in sales, the West area leads, closely followed by the East. The South region, on the other hand, generates the least amount of revenue ($501K), suggesting that market intervention is necessary. 

•	Technology generates the highest total sales (about $836k), followed by Furniture. These are our growth engines

• When the category is Office Supplies, sales are most likely to decline. This indicates that although technology generates large sums of money, our average order value is statistically declining due to the large volume of low-value office supply transactions.


## Recommendations: 

•	For Operations:  Examine low-value subcategories such as labels and fasteners. In order to boost total profit, these things should be eliminated or packaged with other products if they are excessively expensive to ship or fulfil in relation to their pricing.

•	For Marketing: Use the high frequency of Office Supplies sales as an upselling opportunity. Whenever a customer buys a low-cost item, the system should prompt a promotion for a higher-margin product to quickly lift the Average Order Value.
